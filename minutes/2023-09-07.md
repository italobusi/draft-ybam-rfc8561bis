Attendees: Scott, Martin, Alex, Jean, Jonas, Daniela, Italo, Danilo

Discussed the options for BCA Issue (https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/2)
Option one creates a new iana iftype and the other option adds the attributes related to the hierarchical case to the existing microwave radio link terminal augmentation of IETF Interface.

Way forward:
- discuss examples of instances to come to closure on modeling
- discuss the leafs that are needed to support the hierarchical case
- discuss Daniela's scenarios related to 4+1 and others

This comment contains two options for the model to use for instance examples to help evaluate the direction forward. https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/2#issuecomment-1710656419
