To subscribe to the CCAMP Mailing List: https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ccamp

This draft is an "individual draft" which means the draft has not yet been accepted by the IETF CCAMP working group as a "working group" document.  Once the participants of this call are happy with the draft, we should utilize the CCAMP mailing to indicate the desire for this work to be a "working group" draft and show support and demontrate the effort put into creating the draft.

Issue #2 : BCA

Reviewed the material in the BCA (Band and Carrier Aggregation) issue.  Jonas reviewed this: https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/files/8906436/Key.Concepts.-.Bonding.BCA.pptx
The presentation provides a suggestion that will modify the model to support hierarchical radio link terminals.  What is still undecided is whether to request a new IANA iftype or add properties to the existing IANA iftype for "radio-link-terminal".

Jonas' presentation shows an instance example of leveraging a new ianaiftype.

Further information/discussion is needed to deal with how one radio-link-terminal can point to another radio-link-terminal.
