Notes:
Closed Action 1, the gap analysis has been completed and turned into other actions.

Band & Carrier Aggregation:
Consider changing interface augmentation to deprecate the mode definition and add a new “mode” container that specifically supports an X leaf and a Y leaf, where X is number of bonded carriers and Y is the number of protecting carriers, to make “mode” more flexible and rules can be created to validate that the number of carrier-terminations matches the new “mode” definition.
Actiton to create an example.
