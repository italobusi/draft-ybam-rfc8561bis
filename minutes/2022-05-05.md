Band and Carrier Aggregation

BCA-groups discussion.  Add a group that contains a name for the group, whether to the group is enabled or not, a list of interface members, and an optional main-member interface.  (avoiding master terminology).

Ensure the BCA group covers everything the MW industry has everything related to Band and Carrier Aggregation, not just load balancing.  Make clear the definition of BCA.  If it is called BCA, make sure scope is covered.  Including within one radio.

ETSI ISG mWT group definition should be reviewed.

Have a proposal for an update to the model, all requested to review and share comments.

Plug test is starting on Tuesday 10 May.  The plug test has a requirement for a 2+0 load balanced use-case.

Create items for each identified attributes, including reference mode.

Next Meeting: 12 May 2022 at Noon CEST
