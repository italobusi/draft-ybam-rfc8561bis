Status


Martin introduced: https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/blob/main/presentations/ietf-onf-process.docx
Which provides the following steps to do the analysis
Step #0: Ignore (parts of the onf-air-interface objects/leafs to ignore)
Step #1: Identify onf-air-interface PM data, which are not covered by ietf.
Step #2: Ignore status attributes which are covered by NMDA.
Step #3: Identify onf-air-interface configuration attributes which are not covered by ietf.
Step #4: Identify onf-air-interface status attributes which are not covered by ietf.
Step #5: updates on Capabilities if needed. 

Discussion centered on PM data and the fact that the IETF radio-link YANG doesn't include Historical Data that is assessible by YANG.
The reason is that historical PM data utilized the 3GPP streaming mechanism that is file based for historical data.
There is no "PM Job Control" YANG definition in the IETF.

The NMDA discussion will continue at the next meeting.
When further discussions have been completed the gap analysis and proposals will be added as "issues" here: https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues
