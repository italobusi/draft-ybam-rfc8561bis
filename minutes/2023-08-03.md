IETF 117 Recap
* Microwave Topology Draft finished Last Call
  * All comments have been reviewed and responded to
  * Only technical change was to support "multi-technology" alignment CCAMP agreed to for all topology-related drafts
  * Next steps are:
    * Update JSON Examples
    * Update Markdown
    * Regenerate Draft
    * Submit it to datatracker
    * Contact the Chairs to determine if another last call is needed or to contact the shephard for the next steps

Microwave Radio Link
* In O-RAN Working Group 9 there is a desire to have a microwave radio link model
* Martin and Alex have a gap analysis between the ONF and IETF microwave radio link models that was done for O-RAN
* The goal of the discussion is to determine if the IETF model can be enhanced to cover the requirements and use-cases needed by O-RAN WG9, so they don't create another microwave model.
* Martin and Alex will create issues to capture the discussion points

Next Meeting is 10 August 2023
