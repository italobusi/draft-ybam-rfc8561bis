Attendees: Scott, Jonas Daniela, Danilo

Agenda:

Discuss RFC 8561 and Radio Link issues related to coding-modulation
[Issue #13](https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/13)
Danilo described an alternative to using IdentifyRef for coding-modulation.
Use a grouping that includes the characteristics of the adaptive coding modulation, rather than a reference to an identity that describes the coding modulation.
In order to evaluate the proposal, it was suggested that a draft yang module be created and instance data examples created using both the existing model in RFC8561 and the new proposed model.
The target is to have the examples created for the 13 April meeting.
