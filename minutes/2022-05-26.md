Notes: 
Discussion of Issue #9.  Updated ietf-microwave-types.yang and ietf-microwave-radio-link.yang to deprecate mode and introduce a new rlt-mode container.
Used an example in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning (B.2) that describes how to change the type of a leaf node.
However, there is a tooling issue with pyang that has been identified, so a small example has been created to demonstrate the issue.
The issue is that using "choice" as described in the yang-module-versioning draft is identified as a non backward compatible change.
However, test cases were created that shows the XML and JSON instance data is compatible.
See.. https://github.com/samans/testing-yang/tree/main/mw-option for an example.
The original (using the old style mode) is in mw-option@2022-04-01.yang.
the new version of mode (rlt-mode) is in mw-option@2022-05-26.yang.
The xml file mw-option.xml which uses the deprecated style of mode, works with the mw-option@2022-05-26.yang.
The pyang error message is in nbc.out.  This is a tooling issue that should be addressed as the yang-module-versioning draft is progressed.
